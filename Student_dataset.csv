The trumpets blare and trombones slide, Saxophones wailing side by side, Rhythm guitar hitting upstrokes tight, Bass and drums keeping everything right. The moon is high and spirits higher, Our energy could not get any wirer, Dancing till our legs give out, This is what ska is all about.

Checkered patterns all around, Black and white cover every sound, Unity in rhythm found, As the beat continues to astound.

The Checkered Vans,Sidewalk Surfing,1998,ska,"Concrete waves beneath my feet, Riding rhythms down the street, Checkered patterns black and white, Skanking through the city night. Four wheels rolling smooth and fast, Present moving through the past, Soundtrack blasting in my ears, Melting away all my fears. The cityscape becomes my ocean, Fluid movements in constant motion, Every crack a wave to ride, Every turn a changing tide. The Checkered Vans provide the sound, As I skate from town to town, Wheels and rhythm both aligned, Freedom for the searching mind. People stare as I roll by, Questions forming in their eyes, But I'm too caught in the groove, To explain why I must move.

The night belongs to those who know, That rhythm helps the spirit grow, Moonlight Skatalites lead the charge, Making small emotions large. Shadows dance against the wall, As the horns begin to call, Inviting everyone to join, Before the moment we purloin. The midnight rude is not a mood, But how we dance and share our food, Community in darkness found, When we gather for this sound. Cities sleep but we're awake, So much music left to make, Until the morning light appears, Chasing away our nightly fears. Tomorrow we return to jobs, Blending with the daily mobs, But tonight we stand apart, Midnight rude within our heart."

These shoes have traveled many miles, Across dance floors with different styles, But nothing feels quite as sweet, As when they find the perfect beat. The leather's worn but soul intact, With every step they counteract, The pressure of the working day, As horns begin to lead the way. When guitar upstrokes set the pace, These shoes will find their perfect place, Sliding across the wooden floor, Always hungry for some more. The Upstrokes play till break of dawn, While feet keep moving on and on, These shoes won't let you down tonight, They'll keep you dancing till first light. Sweat may soak through to your socks, As rhythm through your body rocks, But these shoes were made to take the strain, Dancing through the joy and pain.
